      "So, let's restate the idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to generate a variable X under the density $f$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$S(f) = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : 0 \\leq y \\leq f(x) \\}$$\n",

      "**Proposition 4.1**\n",
      "\n",
      "$(X,Y)$ is a random point uniformly distributed in $S(f)$, then\n",
      "$X$ has density $f$.\n",
      "\n",
      "if $X$ has density $f$ and the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is $U(0, f(X))$, $(X,Y)$ is uniformly distribution over $S(f)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal therefore is to generate $(X, Y)$ uniformly in $S(f)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**The idea**\n",
      "The trick to achieve that is to generate $(X,Y)$ in a space that encloses S(f) and check if $(X, Y) \\in S(f)$. If it does belong, then\n",
      "we return it as a random point of the density $S(f)$, otherwise we try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**The problem**\n",
      "So if the enclosing space is huge in relation to the volume of $S(f)$, it would be expected that very few points actually land in $S(f)$ and therefore most of the randomly generate points are lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, depending on the shape of the enclosing space and $S(f)$, this procedure can become extremely wasteful or work pretty well.\n",

      "\n",
      "**The hat function trick (majoring function)**\n",
      "The idea is to scale a know density function $g$ over $S(f)$ from which the sampling\n",
