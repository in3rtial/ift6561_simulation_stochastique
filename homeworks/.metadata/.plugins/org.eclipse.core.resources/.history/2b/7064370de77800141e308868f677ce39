	In the call center example of Section 6.2.2, suppose the service times are
	Erlang(k, γ) and we generate each of them as follows: generate k independent
	exponentials with mean 1/γ by inversion and add them up. Prove that this
	method is equivalent to direct inversion of the Erlang (or gamma) distribution
	function in terms of maximizing the correlation between the service times of
	corresponding calls in the two systems.
